# Auction Platform â€“ Real-Time Bidding App (Streamlit + MongoDB)

This project is a real-time auction platform built using Streamlit and MongoDB.
It allows users to register as buyers or sellers. Sellers can create auction items with a base price and time duration, while buyers can place bids in real-time. The system automatically updates the highest bid and declares the winner once the auction ends.
